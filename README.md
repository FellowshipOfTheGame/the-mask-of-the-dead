# The Masks of the Dead

You play as Hideki, a student who is locked inside one of the university building on a zombie apocalypse. You need to be smart, sneak through zombies without killing them or draw atention. You can craft items, but you don't have any kind of weapon. Your objective, of course, is get out of the building before get killed.
